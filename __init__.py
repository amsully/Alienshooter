NOTES UPDATED 7/1/2014
Alex's Notes
    (7/1/2014)
    - Comments added up until the bubble class. Some noted TODO are getting the rotation of cannon to work, better cannon graphic, and learning/implementing pygame sprites..and more.
    - Finally got the chain to be recognized - Finished debugging (swapped while loop for for loop and worked every test)
    - Need to comment code -- will probably spend time writing good comments.
    (Late June)
    - Been working on recognizing the chain. Made some good progress and as you can see based on the True's when you run the code there are some connections being made.
    - My work will continue to polish this backend chain identification. You will notice I added more methods to the Bubble class and completely got RID of the placeBubble method.
    - Hashs (#) that are all the way to the left represents Code that is commented out. I also denoted most of my comments with a Date (6/25/14) so you can see what I did.
    - Also note: The GameWorld class does not really do anything right now... It will be used once the graphics and mechanis are done and we can add levels, moving bubbles, etc.
    - Let me know if you have any questions
    - QUICK TEST FOR PULL REQUEST
